# AI-Powered-Smart-Glasses-for-Visually-Impaired
This project enhances independence for visually impaired individuals by using stereo cameras and the StereoBM algorithm for real-time obstacle detection and voice alerts. With a voice command interface, users can access object detection, image captioning, and text recognition, promoting autonomy and inclusion in a visually oriented world.
