# AI-Powered-Smart-Glasses-for-Visually-Impaired
This project enhances independence for visually impaired individuals by using stereo cameras and the StereoBM algorithm for real-time obstacle detection and voice alerts. With a voice command interface, users can access object detection, image captioning, and text recognition, promoting autonomy and inclusion in a visually oriented world.
## Abstract
Visually impaired individuals encounter significant challenges navigating and interacting with their surroundings. Simple tasks, such as safely traversing through crowded
areas or identifying objects, pose considerable difficulties due to the lack of visual cues.
Moreover, the inability to perceive spatial distances increases the risk of collisions
and accidents, limiting their independence and overall quality of life. Traditional
aids, while helpful, often fall short in providing comprehensive solutions, leaving
gaps in essential functionalities like real-time obstacle detection and efficient access
to information.
The system aims to alleviate these challenges by seamlessly integrating cuttingedge technologies. Utilizing stereo cameras and the StereoBM algorithm, the system
accurately estimate distances to detect obstacles, facilitating a voice alert system
for user safety. The intuitive voice command interface empowers users to access
a range of functionalities seamlessly, from object detection to image captioning and
text recognition, providing invaluable assistance in daily tasks and enhancing overall
accessibility and independence. Through the integration of edge AI and innovative
computing, our system endeavors to revolutionize the experience of visually impaired
individuals, fostering greater autonomy and inclusion in a visually oriented world.
